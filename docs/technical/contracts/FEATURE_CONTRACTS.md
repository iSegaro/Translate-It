# Feature Behavioral Contracts

Authoritative reference for the **observable, feature-level behavior** of all user-facing translation modes after the shared translation pipeline returns an accepted result or a typed failure.

- **Owner(s)**: feature consumers (`UnifiedModeCoordinator` routing, `DomTranslatorAdapter`, `PdfTranslationCoordinator`, `PageTranslationScheduler`, `SubtitleTranslationCoordinator`, selection/window handlers, Popup and Sidepanel stores and components).
- **Scope**: selection, field, element, popup, sidepanel, whole-page, PDF, and subtitle translation.
- **Status**: finalized for the documented scope.

This document defines feature-level behavior only. It references, but does not replace, the shared pipeline contracts.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines **feature-level observable behavior** after the shared translation pipeline returns accepted results or typed failures.

The shared pipeline validates and classifies results. Each feature consumer decides how **source presentation is preserved or mutated**.

```text
shared pipeline
→ validates and classifies results

feature consumer
→ decides how source presentation is preserved or mutated
```

Source preservation is a **feature decision**, not a provider fallback. The shared pipeline never silently substitutes the original source text as a successful translation; features state explicitly what happens to original content on failure.

Sibling contract: [TRANSLATION_IDENTITY_AND_FRAGMENT_CONTRACT.md](TRANSLATION_IDENTITY_AND_FRAGMENT_CONTRACT.md) defines the structured identity/fragment rules shared by Select Element and PDF. This document covers the per-feature observable contract on top of those rules.

---

## 2. Shared Feature Invariants

The following invariants hold for every feature unless a section below explicitly overrides them.

```text
valid complete result
→ may be applied

failed / missing / invalid result
→ original source remains

explicit source-equal result
→ valid

timeout
→ TRANSLATION_TIMEOUT

cancellation
→ USER_CANCELLED

late settlement
→ ignored

same logical identity
→ applied at most once
```

Additional invariants:

- **No nonblank source may be replaced by blank translated output.** A blank translation result is a failure; the feature keeps the original.
- **Completed independent units may remain applied after a later failure.** Features process units independently; a later failure does not roll back already-accepted earlier units (see [Partial Success Contract](#13-partial-success-contract)).
- **No raw V2/V3 fragment reaches feature consumers.** Fragments are assembled by the shared pipeline; features defensively suppress any fragment that still leaks through (Select Element and PDF directly).
- **Feature counters must exclude suppressed or unresolved results.** Terms `translated`, `failed`, `skipped`, `unresolved`, and `partial` describe logical feature outcomes, never raw provider statistics.

## 3. Feature Matrix

| Feature | Mutation owner | Partial success | Revert support | Timeout owner | Cancellation owner |
| ------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Selection Window | none (read-only overlay) | n/a (single result) | not needed | `TranslationHandler` (window manager) | `WindowsManager.cancelCurrentTranslation` |
| Inline Selection | none (tooltip overlay) | n/a (single result) | not needed | `TranslationHandler.performTranslation` | `HoverTranslationManager._cancelPendingHover` |
| Select Element | `DomTranslatorAdapter` + `BlockGroupReconstructor` | yes (per-unit, A/B/C kept) | manual via `SelectElementManager.revertTranslations` | pipeline (`ErrorTypes.TRANSLATION_TIMEOUT`) | `SelectElementManager.handleKeyDown` → `deactivate({ fromCancel })` |
| Field | smart-handler replacement service | n/a (single value) | no (write-on-apply) | shared pipeline | `cancelTranslation` via `useUnifiedTranslation` / `dataStore.abortExistingRequest` |
| Popup | none (app-owned store) | n/a (single result) | not needed | shared pipeline | `cancelTranslation` (silent reset) |
| Sidepanel | none (app-owned store) | n/a (single result) | not needed | shared pipeline | `cancelTranslation` |
| Whole Page | `PageTranslationManager` → `PageTranslationScheduler` | yes (per-batch, kept) | yes (`restorePage`) | `Promise.race` timeout (shared) | `cancelTranslation` → abort + `restorePage` |
| PDF | `PdfTranslationCoordinator` + `PdfTranslationAdapter` | yes (per-cell, kept) | no per-block revert | `getAbortTimeout` / `TRANSLATION_TIMEOUT` | `cancelActiveTranslation` (bumps `runId`) |
| Subtitle | `SubtitleTranslationCoordinator` | yes (per-cue, kept) | no revert of committed cues | `Promise.race` (5-min) | `cancelJob` → `status: cancelled` |

Feature mutation ownership:

- **Selection Window / Inline / Popup / Sidepanel** do not mutate the page; they render into overlay or app-owned UI.
- **Field / Select Element / Whole Page / PDF / Subtitle** own mutations and are responsible for per-unit application and any revert.

---

## 4. Selection Window Contract

Modes: text-selection window (`SelectionWindow`), `Selection`/`Selection_Window` dispatch.

- **Trigger**: from text selection (`mouseup` in text-selection handlers).
- **Source DOM remains unchanged.** The window is a shadow-DOM Vue overlay; it never writes page text.
- **Valid result** appears in the translation window via `TranslationDisplay`.
- **Invalid / timeout / cancel / error** becomes error state (`isError`, `errorType`, `canRetry`).
- **Closed or stale window must not accept late results.** `useWindowsManager.handleUpdateWindow` drops updates whose `id` is no longer present ("Window was closed before translation completed"); a late result cannot recreate a dismissed window. `TranslationHandler` also keys on `messageId` and returns `false` for unmatched results.
- **No revert needed** because the source is never mutated.
- **Source-equal translation remains valid.** It is non-destructive and stored as normal content.

---

## 5. Inline Selection Contract

Modes: hover / mouse-on-hover inline tooltip.

- **Selected page text is never replaced.** `HoverTranslationManager` only manages highlight classes and tooltip states; it never writes text to the page.
- **Result box appears only for accepted output.** `_processHover` emits ready only when `currentMessageId` matches and `translatedText` is truthy; the tooltip also skips a missing translation.
- **Loading UI settles on success / error / timeout / cancel.** Streaming settles via `isStreaming`; error → `showError`; timeout → `showError`; cancel → ignored (no UI error) and the tooltip hides.
- **Duplicate result/display prevented.** Ready only emitted when message id matches; a redundant (source-equal) result hides the tooltip rather than displaying.
- **Late result cannot recreate a dismissed box.** `_cancelPendingHover` bumps `messageId`; old resolve/reject does not match.

---

## 6. Select Element Contract

Modes: `Select_Element`.

- **DOM mutation owned by `DomTranslatorAdapter`** (via `_applyTranslationToNode`; block groups via `BlockGroupReconstructor.apply`).
- **Accepted units are applied independently and immediately** (synchronously within the stream/direct loop; no batch flush/commit phase).
- **Failed units remain original** — failure is recorded by omission (UID→node resolution simply never calls `_applyTranslationToNode`), so a failed node is untouched.
- **Partial success scenario: A success, B failure, C success** → nodes A and C stay translated; node B remains original. No rollback of completed independent units on a later provider failure.
- **Raw fragments suppressed** at the adapter boundary (`isSplitFragment` / `isV3Fragment` → skip before any write).
- **Duplicate logical identities applied once** via UID + `processedUnits` set.
- **Esc / user cancellation**: `SelectElementManager.handleKeyDown` → `deactivate({ fromCancel: true })` → `cancelTranslation`. It does **not** revert already-applied partial translations.
- **Revert** (`SelectElementManager.revertTranslations`) restores the **original text and direction metadata** (`restoreElementDirection`, removes `data-has-original`).
- **Block-group reconstruction is atomic.** `BlockGroupReconstructor` validates first (segment markers, node connectivity/content), then commits all units synchronously. Atomicity is enforced through validation plus transactional rollback: validation occurs before mutation, mutation may then begin, and a mutation-phase failure triggers best-effort rollback of the affected transaction. Rollback failures are aggregated as secondary diagnostics and never replace the primary mutation failure.

Revert can be invoked for a partial state: `preserveTranslations` keeps intervening decomposable successes; only reverted on explicit user action.

---

## 7. Field Contract

Modes: `Field` (`textarea`, `contentEditable`) via smart-translation field service and text-field interactions.

Coverage includes `input` and `textarea`, `contentEditable`, and framework-controlled fields.

- **Ctrl+/ and inline icon use the same behavioral contract.** Both funnel into `translateFieldViaSmartHandler({ text, target })` (icon manager and shortcut handler) before applying results.
- **Failed / invalid / empty translation leaves the field value unchanged.** The application service throws without writing; a failed insert returns false with no DOM mutation.
- **Cursor/selection must not be corrupted.** Replacement goes through via `range`/selectionStart/End and re-setSelectionRange after applying.
- **Accepted update emits only the required `input`/`change` events** (with `bubbles`), not synthetic unrelated events.
- **Cancellation never clears user text.** Cancellation dismisses UI and discards pending data without modifying `target`.
- **Stale translation instance cannot overwrite newer user input.** `translateFieldViaSmartHandler` aborts on an existing request for the same target, and a pending-result guard (`STALE_DATA_THRESHOLD` timestamp) drops stale data.
- **Source-equal output is valid** — it is accepted and, being identical to the field value, applies as an effective no-op.

Same-language popup fallback explicitly does NOT apply to fields within the field path; fields only write a truly accepted result.

---

## 8. Popup Contract

Modes: `Popup Translation` (direct result in the popup UI).

- **Input remains visible on failure.** Textarea keeps `sourceText`; only the result area resets.
- **Result area contains only accepted output.** On error `translatedText` is cleared and the error state is shown. **No source fallback is inserted as a translation** on failure.
- **Same-language display caveat:** when source and target languages are equal, the popup app may display the original text as the result. This is a deliberate display behavior, not a source fallback on failure; it is never used to mask a failed translation.
- **Spinner always settles** on success, error, no-valid-response, timeout, or cancel.
- **Copy / TTS controls are enabled only for valid result content.** The display toolbar renders only when content is non-empty (not loading).
- **Cancellation and timeout remain distinct.** Cancel is a silent reset with no error state; timeout is a typed `TRANSLATION_TIMEOUT` error state.
- **Direct result does not mutate page content.** `UnifiedResultDispatcher` routes `Popup_Translate` results directly back to the popup; it does not dispatch Popup mode to the tab. (History persistence writes to storage, not the DOM.)

---

## 9. Sidepanel Contract

Modes: `Sidepanel Translation`, `Popup Translation`-equivalent direct result in the app.

- **Same direct-translation result contract as Popup.** It reuses the same unified composable/store and direct-mode principle: source remains, result area shows only accepted output, no source fallback on failure.
- **Persistent view lifecycle.** Local refs and store keep the current translation across panel usage.
- **Stale request protection.** A `pendingRequests` set filters out late/unknown results; the awaited response or a matching id is the only accepted terminal.
- **Result/history state after error:** source kept in the textarea, result cleared to error state; no history write is recorded (history records only success).
- **Page source remains unchanged.** Sidepanel results return directly to the app and are never dispatched to the tab DOM.
- **Navigation or panel closure prevents late UI mutation.** `onUnmounted` removes the message listener and clears pending requests signal so late updates are dropped.

---

## 10. Whole Page Contract

Modes: `whole_page` / batch translation.

- **Page mutation owned by the page-translation feature** (`PageTranslationManager` → `PageTranslationBridge`, which wraps the `domtranslator` library).
- **Accepted nodes are applied independently** (each text/attribute node translated via `NodesTranslator`, driven by `DomTranslator`'s per-node walk).
- **Failed nodes remain original.** An errored batch item is resolved but the node's original text is retained and the DOM is not marked translated.
- **Explicit skipped results remain original.** An item with `isSkipped === true` resolves to its original text, increments `failedCount`, never increments `translatedCount`, and does not prevent other valid items in the same batch from being applied.
- **Completed nodes remain translated after a later failure/timeout.** Already-settled resolved nodes are not rolled back; only the in-flight batch is affected.
- **Blank output keeps the original node text.** When the translated value is empty, the bridge keeps the node's original text (no blank replaces nonblank source). Blank string results may still increment `translatedCount` under the known scheduler counting gap.
- **Source-equal output is valid.** Identity translations are accepted results and must not be classified as skipped or failed; they may still increment `translatedCount` under the same known counting gap.
- **Progress uses terminal counts (translated + failed) against the total.** Counts describe logical nodes, not provider statistics. Suppressed (context-mismatched, empty, excluded) items are excluded from totals before counting. Current-code note: blank or source-equal string results may still be tallied as translated even when the DOM keeps the original text. The intended invariant — blank/duplicate results do not increment the translated count — is **not** met by the current scheduler. Flagged as a gap, not documented as fact.
- **Nested/child omission:** traversal recurses into shadow roots and visits all text nodes and translatable attributes (`title`, `alt`, `placeholder`); nodes for excluded selectors / internal UI hosts and empty text are omitted from translation and counting.
- **Cancellation:** `cancelTranslation` aborts the current session and prevents partial commits of in-flight un-committed nodes; committed nodes follow the feature's revert policy.
- **Revert behavior and metadata ownership.** Full-page revert (`restorePage`) calls the underlying translator's `restore` to restore original node text and then deep-cleans page markers (`data-page-translated`, direction, original-text metadata), restoring both translation markers and direction.

A batch is not individually atomic-in-partial: only the in-flight batch is bounded by failure; committed earlier nodes persist.

---

## 11. PDF Contract

Modes: `pdf_translation` (whole document) and structured cell batches.

- **Block/cell application owned by `PdfTranslationCoordinator` + `PdfTranslationAdapter`.** Results applied into session state (`setBlockTranslationState`).
- **Structured cells use `cellId`** to disambiguate cells within a block; `lineIndex`/`cellIndex` position cells, `cellId` identifies.
- **Numeric `cellId: 0` is valid** and preserved (identity uses nullish, not truthy `||`).
- **null/undefined/blank translated slot becomes unresolved/error** (normalizes to empty; a block whose text is empty becomes error).
- **Original rendered PDF content remains available.** The source cell text is stored alongside and, when a cell is unresolved, the overlay preserves the original text for display. This is source preservation — the original is never emitted as a *translated* result.
- **Explicit source-equal output is valid** (status set by presence, not by inequality to source).
- **Missing cell keeps position and does not shift later cells.** Position is placed at the local index (write `cells[cellIndex]`); a gap does not slide later cells.
- **A mixed block may contain valid and unresolved cells.** Missing/empty cells become empty holes; the block falls back to source for those cells.
- **Block-level status rules:** block status is per-block scalar — `idle / loading / routed / translated / error`; on empty it is `error`; a run-level summary can be `partial` when `failedCount > 0`.
- **Duplicate cell identity:** within a batch, the last result at the same position overwrites; an identity duplicate produced by the pipeline is suppressed here.
- **No raw fragments in final PDF results.** Only assembled cells are applied; fragments are not concatenated into final results.

---

## 12. Subtitle Contract

Modes: `subtitle_translation`.

```text
under-returned result
→ isSkipped
→ original cue preserved
→ failed count increments
```

Additional rules:

- **Blank / whitespace output fails** — treated as missing translation.
- **Explicit source-equal translation remains valid** — never a failure.
- **Cue timing/order is unchanged** — cues keep parse order and serialize them in that order (in-place array order).
- **Failed cues serialize using original text.** Export writes `translatedText` only when present; otherwise the cue's `text`.
- **Mixed batch counts translated and failed accurately** — `validateAndRestore` sets per-cue status; the progress tracker sums `translated`, `failed`, `skipped`.
- **Timeout/cancel does not write late translated text.** Timeout (`Promise.race`) marks the cue failed; late-resolving value ignored. Cancel sets the job status without writing later cue contents.
- **No rollback of already translated independent cues.** Each batch settles independently; a later fatal error keeps earlier committed cues.

---

## 13. Partial Success Contract

Shared example:

```text
A succeeds
B fails
C succeeds
```

Expected behavior by feature:

| Feature | A/B/C result | Revert on later failure | Counts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Select Element | A, C applied; B original | no | A/C marked accepted, B failed |
| Whole Page | A, C translated; B original | no (completed nodes kept) | translated=2, failed=1 |
| PDF | A, C cells/block accepted; B unresolved | no | translated + failed from block states |
| Subtitle | A, C translated; B failed (original) | no | translated=2, failed=1 |

Required result:

```text
A/C accepted
B original
counts accurate
no global rollback
terminal state reports partial/failure accurately
```

Exceptions:

- **Select Element** supports *explicit* whole-session revert of completed units (manual, not automatic) — distinct from automatic rollback.
- **Whole Page `stopAutoTranslation`** stops producing new translations but leaves committed nodes (no revert) by design.
- **PDF block** is `error` when its text is empty; a run is `partial` only at the run summary level, never a block-level partial.

---

## 14. Timeout and Cancellation

Ownership and distinction:

```text
timeout
→ TRANSLATION_TIMEOUT
→ no late mutation

user cancellation
→ USER_CANCELLED
→ no late mutation
```

- **Terminal request state is immutable.** After a request reaches a terminal state (success / timeout / cancel), a later settlement is ignored (`TranslationRequestTracker`, dispatcher processed-set, handler guards).
- **Abort-related late `USER_CANCELLED` after a timeout is suppressed.** A cancel arriving on an already timed-out request does not override the timeout outcome.
- **Feature UI must not reinterpret timeout as cancellation.** They are distinct typed states; features render them differently (e.g. Popup: timeout → error state, cancel → silent).
- **Previously completed units follow the feature's approved partial-success policy** (unchanged by a later timeout/cancel).

---

## 15. Source Preservation vs Source Fallback

Distinguish:

```text
source preservation
→ feature leaves original presentation unchanged after failure

source fallback
→ original source inserted as translated output
```

```text
source preservation is required
source fallback is prohibited
```

Examples of valid source-equal translations (NOT failures, NOT fallback):

```text
URL → URL
OpenAI → OpenAI
2026 → 2026
```

- Source-equal output is a **valid accepted result**, meaning a consumer must not treat equality as a failure.
- Source-equal is **never** a fallback (the source was not substituted as a success).

---

## 16. Feature Consumer Guarantees

Feature consumers may **assume**:

- typed terminal errors (timeout vs cancel distinct);
- no source-filled invalid result;
- no raw fragments;
- an accepted identity set already deduplicated where the structured handler applies;
- timeout/cancel late settlements are suppressed;
- unresolved object results may carry explicit status metadata such as `isSkipped`.

Feature consumers **must not**:

- infer failure from text equality;
- convert missing results into successful source text;
- apply blank translated output to nonblank text;
- independently retry providers;
- rebuild fragments.

---

## 17. Diagnostics and Progress

- Feature progress counters are **not** actual provider statistics.
- `translated` / `failed` counts describe logical feature units.
- Suppressed duplicates do not count as translated.
- Unresolved subtitle/PDF units count as failed.
- Diagnostics must avoid raw source or translation bodies unless sanitized.

---

## 20. Current Code Gaps <a name="current-gaps"></a>

Known deviations between this document's stated invariant and current production behavior. These are flagged as gaps, not documented as facts:

- **Whole Page translated counter.** Blank or source-equal string output accepted for a batch item may increment `translatedCount`, even though the DOM keeps the original text. Intended invariant "blank/duplicate results do not increment translated count" is not yet met. Explicit `isSkipped === true` results are excluded from this gap: they increment `failedCount` instead.
- **PDF `cellId: 0`** is valid at the mapping layer (nullish identity), but the overlay mask lookup uses a truthy guard, so string-keyed cells are the practical path.
- **Popup same-language display** writes the source into the result area when languages match. This is an explicit display behavior, not a source fallback on failure, and must not be generalized to other features.
- **Field service-tier guarantees** (cursor preservation, event dedup, stale override) are not directly unit-tested; only the legacy framework-compat path is asserted.
